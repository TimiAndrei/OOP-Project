# GameStop

## 1. Introduction 🌟

Welcome to the GameStop project! This university project focuses on applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns to create a simplified model for a game store. The project aims to enhance your understanding of OOP concepts, design patterns, and their practical application in software development.

## 2. Project Overview 🎮

The GameStop project simulates a basic game store system, incorporating various OOP principles and design patterns. The system allows users to interact with the console, having an interactive menu for purchasing items, instantiating new objects, applying offers and other features.

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming Principles 🧱

The project emphasizes the following OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation:** Data and methods related to a specific class are encapsulated within that class, promoting data hiding and abstraction.

- **Inheritance:** Classes are organized in a hierarchical structure to promote code reusability and the creation of specialized classes.

- **Polymorphism:** Objects can take on multiple forms, allowing for flexibility in method implementation through interfaces and abstract classes.

- **Abstraction:** The project ensures that class implementations reveal only crucial details, promoting a streamlined design.

## 4. Design Patterns 🎨

### Singleton Pattern 🏰

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In the project, the menu class is implemented as a Singleton to manage shop-related operations.

### Prototype Pattern 🔄

The Prototype pattern allows the project to include the ability to clone Gaming system objects. This pattern facilitates the creation of new instances by copying existing ones, providing an efficient way to create similar objects without the need for intricate setup.
